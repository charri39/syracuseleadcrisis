      <p>When Syracuse resident Darlene Medley’s twins were 19 months old, their blood tests came back with elevated levels of lead. The twins were suffering from lead poisoning because of lead in the home the family was renting.</p>

      <p>Months after the initial tests, Medley’s twins were tested again, and their blood levels had dropped to 4.2 mcg/dL, below New York State’s 5 mcg/dL threshold for elevated lead. With renewed optimism, Medley had her home retested for lead, but the level of lead in the home had quintupled. </p>

      <p>When Medley tried to work with her new landlord to mitigate this level of lead in her home, she found him uncooperative and entered a “back and forth battle” between her landlord and the county health department. </p>

      <p>She later found out her house had been deemed unfit for human habitation for over a year, but she was never notified. Child Protective Services got involved, she said, and Medley was informed that she could no longer be in the house.

        <p>“There was no room for us to go anywhere,” she said. “All the shelters were booked, all the hotels were booked.”</p>

        <p>This is a reality for many people in the city of Syracuse. When lead is discovered in a home, families are often left with few choices to keep their children safe. As the lead crisis continues in Syracuse, county and city officials are working to mitigate its effects on children and prevent further poisoning.</p>

        <p>Debra Lewis, program coordinator for Onondaga County’s Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, said she expects to see roughly the same share of children with elevated test results at the end of this year compared to those from last year.</p>

        <p>Lewis called these elevated blood lead level data points a “persistent and stubborn statistic,” explaining that the data reflects the population and housing conditions in the high-risk areas of the city. New York State has identified five zip codes in the city of Syracuse — 13203, 13204, 13205, 13207 and 13208 — as high-risk for childhood lead exposure. </p>
      
        <p>These five zip codes, Lewis explained, have the highest concentration of poverty, rental housing and families receiving at least one support benefit like Medicaid or WIC in the city. Beyond that, the highest number of <a href="https://dailyorange.com/2022/02/income-race-high-levels-lead-syracuse/" target="_blank">families of color</a> live in these zip codes, and the homes within the areas are more likely to be associated with overlapping code enforcement issues, Lewis said.</p>

        <p>Building on this, Travis Hobart — the medical director of the Central and Eastern New York Lead Poisoning Resource <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/healthcare/providers/location.php?clinicID=872" target="_blank">Center</a>  — explained a link between historically divested neighborhoods with poorly maintained homes and higher rates of lead poisoning, what he called a “historical injustice persisting to this day.”</p>

        <p>“If you look at the map of where things were redlined and you look at the map of where kids have lead poisoning, most likely they line up identically,” Hobart said.</p>

        <p>Ingesting dust from or chips of lead paint, which is common in older homes, is a primary cause of lead poisoning in children. The federal government <a href="https://www.epa.gov/lead/protect-your-family-sources-lead#:~:text=In%201978%2C%20the%20federal%20government,is%20usually%20not%20a%20problem." target="_blank">banned </a> the usage of lead paint in 1978, meaning places with a larger share of older homes have higher rates of lead poisoning, Lewis explained. According to <a href="https://eyeonhousing.org/2023/02/age-of-housing-stock-by-state-4/#:~:text=The%20age%20of%20owner%2Doccupied,more%20than%2080%20years%20ago." target="_blank">data</a> from the National Association of Home Builders, New York has the oldest housing stock in the U.S., with an owner-occupied home median age of 62 years.</p>

        <p>When there is lead in a home, Hobart said there are several ways to go about remedying the situation. It can be covered with other paint, but he said the best way is to remove it entirely. This option, however, requires a contractor certified by the Environmental Protection Agency for renovation, repair, or painting and can release more lead into the environment if not done correctly.</p>

        <p>Hobart and Jessica Vinciguerra, the director of lead operations for Onondaga County, agreed there is a shortage of RRP-certified contractors in the area, which is a major obstacle to overcome in the lead crisis.</p>

        <p>“Even if you want to fix the home and either own it yourself or have a cooperative landlord, there's a waiting time to get a contractor who can actually do it for you in a safe way,” Hobart said.</p>

        <p>In light of this, Vinciguerra said the county has been funding scholarships for contractors to take RRP courses and exams to incentivize the certification.</p>

        <p>Onondaga County, in addition to working on preventative measures like lead paint remediation, has set aside funding for Lead It Go, an <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/health/2022/10/onondaga-county-to-help-lead-poisoned-kids-before-negative-effects-of-toxic-exposure-appear.html" target="_blank">initiative</a> that supports families with children who have elevated blood lead levels, Lewis said. Modeled after a program in Erie County, the initiative provides enrichment services in the home to help mitigate the side effects of lead poisoning, and the only eligibility requirement is an elevated test result for a child in the home, she said.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, Medley is hoping to harness these community resources to build a lead-free safe space for families affected by lead. She said she’s not asking for funding, just approval to use one of the many properties in the Syracuse <a href="https://syracuselandbank.org/" target="_blank"> land bank</a>.</p>

        <p>“We’re not talking about grown people, we’re talking about children that did not ask to be brought into this world, children that are innocent and that are now having their lives destroyed,” Medley said.</p>
